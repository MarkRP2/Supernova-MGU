# Supernova-MGU

I was assigned to collaborate with Supernova MGU, a Canadian company specializing in tracking corporate health violations over the years. Under the direction of the project manager, I investigated potential correlations between seasonality and the frequency of critical and non-critical infractions.

Focusing on the last two years and examining the top three types of infractions, I aimed to uncover any significant patterns. The data revealed a consistent decline in infractions at the end of each year, followed by a steady increase at the beginning of the following year. However, 2024 presented a deviation from this trend, with a noticeable decrease in infractions across all categories from January to May.

Based on these findings, I recommend that we continue to collect and analyze data throughout the year to determine if this downward trend persists. This ongoing analysis will provide more comprehensive insights and help refine our understanding of the factors influencing health violations.
